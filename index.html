Dear fellow-engineer,<br>
<br>
I'm here to validate an idea and to help people. If you're looking for a tech-job then please keep reading.<br><br>
It's been a <i>rough</i> year. According to <a href="https://layoffs.fyi/">layoffs.fyi</a>, there's been over 257k layoffs in our industry this year. It's a really hard market right now.
</p>

<p>
What are we to do?
</p>

<p>That's why you're here, reading a website with hardly any styling (would hate for this to blow up as you'll see later). I'm a backend engineer with no real frontend design skills. I *can* offer one service, however, that I think you'll appreciate.

<p>The agreement is simple. I'll apply to jobs for you based on your skillset and you'll pay me whatever you want when you accept an offer. I'll also run your resume through a scanner and let you know what you can do to improve it.</p>

<p>Let's try this. Shoot me an email if you'd like me to help you find work. Please include any and all relevant information except for super-personal information (please). I need your name, LinkedIn, GitHub, resume, and a detailed explanation of the type of work you're looking for. Please specify if you have any hard requirements, companies you'd like me to avoid, or anything else.</p>

<p>I will NOT sell your information to <b>anyone</b>. I <b>CAN</b> choose to stop working with you at any point, as can you. You <b>could</b> let me find you a job and not pay me a dime but that would be kinda messed up. :-)</p>

<p>Let's see where this goes.</p>

<p>You can contact me for any purpose. Have questions? Want a different arrangement?</p>
